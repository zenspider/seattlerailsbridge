goal_title: Hooking up votes and topics
goal: |

  ![topics_and_votes_table](/img/topics_and_votes_table.png)

  Because there is an explicit relationship between a topic and its
  votes, we need to specify that. In this step, we'll explicitly
  declare the relationship between votes and topics.

steps: |
  
  Edit app/models/topic.rb so that it looks like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :votes
  end
  </pre>
  
  Edit app/models/vote.rb so that it looks like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  class Vote < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :topic
  end
  </pre>

explanation: |
  
  `has_many` and `belongs_to`:

  * In rails, relationships between models are called associations.
  * Associations (usually) come in pairs.
  * A topic will have many votes so we put `has_many :votes` in the
    topic model.
    * When you ask a topic for its votes, you get an array of votes
      for that topic.
  * A vote is for a particular topic, so we put `belongs_to :topic`
    in the vote model.
    * When you ask a vote for its topic, you get the topic for that
      vote.
