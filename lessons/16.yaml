section_title: Flow

  Now that the structure is complete, let's make the flow work smoothly.

goal_title: Setting the default page
goal: |
  
  Currently when you go to http://localhost:3000 you see the "Welcome
  aboard" message.
  
  It would be easier to use our app if http://localhost:3000 went
  directly to the topics list.
  
  In this step we'll make that happen and learn a bit about routes in
  rails.

steps: |
  
  Open `config/routes.rb`. Near the end of the file but before the
  final end add `root :to => 'topics#index'`. When you are
  done the last few lines should look like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
    # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
    # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.
    # match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))'
  
    root :to => 'topics#index'
  end
  </pre>
  
  You also need to remove the welcome aboard page for the new route to
  work. Type this in a terminal window:
  
      git rm public/index.html
  
  Go back to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You
  should be taken to the topics list automatically.

explanation: |
  
  * root :to => 'topics#index' is a rails route that says the default
    address for your site is topics#index. topics#index is the topics
    list page (the topics controller with the index action).
  * Rails routes control how URLs (web addresses) get matched with
    code on the server. Similar to how addresses match with houses and
    apartments.
  * The file config/routes.rb is like an address directory listing the
    possible addresses and which code goes with each one
  * routes.rb uses some shortcuts so it doesn't always show all the
    possible URLs. To explore the URLs in more detail we can use the
    terminal.
  
  At the terminal type <pre> rake routes</pre> you should get
  something that looks like this:

           votes GET    /votes(.:format)           {:action=>"index", :controller=>"votes"}
                 POST   /votes(.:format)           {:action=>"create", :controller=>"votes"}
        new_vote GET    /votes/new(.:format)       {:action=>"new", :controller=>"votes"}
       edit_vote GET    /votes/:id/edit(.:format)  {:action=>"edit", :controller=>"votes"}
            vote GET    /votes/:id(.:format)       {:action=>"show", :controller=>"votes"}
                 PUT    /votes/:id(.:format)       {:action=>"update", :controller=>"votes"}
                 DELETE /votes/:id(.:format)       {:action=>"destroy", :controller=>"votes"}
          topics GET    /topics(.:format)          {:action=>"index", :controller=>"topics"}
                 POST   /topics(.:format)          {:action=>"create", :controller=>"topics"}
       new_topic GET    /topics/new(.:format)      {:action=>"new", :controller=>"topics"}
      edit_topic GET    /topics/:id/edit(.:format) {:action=>"edit", :controller=>"topics"}
           topic GET    /topics/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"show", :controller=>"topics"}
                 PUT    /topics/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"update", :controller=>"topics"}
                 DELETE /topics/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"destroy", :controller=>"topics"}
            root        /                          {:action=>"index", :controller=>"topics"}
  
  This shows all the URLs your application responds to. The code that starts with colons are variables so :id means the id number of the record. The code in parenthesis is optional.
  
  ##### Exploring Routes (optional)
  
  Open up your rails console:
  
      rails console
  
  Now you can have a look at the paths that are available in your app.
  Let's try looking at one of the topics routes we just generated.
  
      app.topics_path
      => "/topics"
      app.topics_url
      => "http://www.example.com/topics"
