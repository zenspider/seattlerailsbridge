goal_title: Clean up links on the topics list
goal: |
  
  Our app is nearly done! The main topics listing page is pretty busy.
  There are a lot of links that aren't necessary.
  
  Let's clean up the topics list page by doing the following:
  
  * Remove the 'show' link
  * Remove the 'edit' link
  * Change 'destroy' to 'delete'

steps: |
  
  Open `app/views/topics/index.html.erb` and remove these two lines:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= link_to 'Show', topic %>&lt;/td>
  &lt;td>&lt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_topic_path(topic) %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>
  
  Change the line with the word 'Destroy' to this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= link_to 'Delete', topic, :confirm => 'Are you sure?', :method => :delete %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>
  
  Now save your file and try reloading in your browser to see the changes.

explanation: |
    
  * The two links we removed were show and edit.  We did this because the title now links to the show page and from the show page you can reach the edit page.

  * The second change we made was to make the link text 'Delete' instead of destroy.
