goal_title: Make the topic title a link
goal: |
  
  Your friends recommended two changes for the site:
  
  * Don't show the description on the list page
  * Make the title a link and when its clicked show the description

steps: |
  
  Let's start by removing the description. Open
  `app/views/topics/index.html.erb` and delete the line that looks
  like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= topic.description %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>
  
  Also delete the line that looks like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
  </pre>
  
  If you save and try to load it in the browser you should see that
  the description no longer appears. Now make the title a link by
  editing `app/views/topics/index.html.erb` (again) and replace this
  line:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= topic.title %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>
  
  with this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= link_to topic.title, topic %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>

explanation: |

  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td><%= topic.description %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>

  This line was getting the description using .description and just printing it out

  <pre class="code">
  &lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
  </pre>

  `<th>` stands for table header and everything between `<th>` and
  `</th>` was being printed as a table header (bold). We removed it
  since we removed the description and it would look funny to have the
  header and the wrong thing below it.


  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td><%= link_to topic.title, topic %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>

  Here's another use of `link_to` to create a link on the page. This
  `link_to` creates a link using the text from the topic title and goes
  to the topic#show page.
